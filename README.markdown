# Short Description

Learn about the ease and beauty of using Rack to develop web applications/frameworks and Phusion Passenger to deploy them.

# Abstract

When you started doing Ruby web development, one of the first pains you probably experienced was getting the application deployed. There was FastCGI, Mongrel, Apache Proxies, Ngnix Proxies, and so on. All of these things were a pain to get working together and generally were not very scalable. 

Then two relatively new technologies met: Rack and Phusion Passenger. A match made in heaven. In my opinion, they've changed the ruby web development and application deployment world as we know it. This is the story of those two projects and how to leverage their simplicity to your advantage.
